# ClearFeed Recipes

A collection of **open source integrations** and **apps** built on the [ClearFeed API](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/api).  
This repository is intended as a **cookbook of reusable patterns** for automations, connectors, and lightweight apps.

## Structure
- **integrations/** – Connect ClearFeed with third-party tools (e.g., Google Sheets, Snowflake, Slack).
- **apps/** – Standalone apps built using ClearFeed APIs (e.g., incident update bots, dashboards).
- **common/** – Shared utilities, clients, or helper libraries.

Each subproject includes its own documentation and setup instructions. See the `README.md` inside each folder for details.
