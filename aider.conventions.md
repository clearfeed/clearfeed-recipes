## Introduction to the Repository

This repository contains a collection of **open source integrations** and **apps** built on the [ClearFeed API](https://docs.clearfeed.ai/api)).  
Each subproject is self-contained and may use different languages, frameworks, and deployment models.

The goal is to provide **recipes** that developers can adapt for their own workflows.

## General Guidelines

- Each integration or app lives in its own subfolder under `integrations/` or `apps/`.
- Each subproject must have:
  - Its own `README.md` with usage/setup instructions.
  - Dependencies isolated (e.g., local `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or equivalent).
  - Clear separation of language/runtime files (donâ€™t mix Node and Python in the same project unless intentional).
- Keep contributions minimal, self-contained, and runnable.

## Language & Frameworks
- Multiple languages are supported across the repo (Python, Node.js, Google App Script, etc.).
- Choose the language best suited for the integration/app being implemented.

## Integrations Folder

### `integrations/google-sheets`
- This folder contains **Google App Script** code for syncing data from ClearFeed REST APIs to Google Sheets and apps inside Google Sheets
- Language: **Google App Script** only.
- Use idiomatic App Script patterns (custom menus, triggers, etc. where appropriate).
- Include a `README.md` with setup steps for deploying Scripts to Sheets.

#### Query Parameters

| Name           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| collection\_id | Number   | Use the `collection_id` parameter to filter requests for a specific collection. Provide the collection's unique identifier to narrow down the results to that collection's requests.                                                 |
| sort\_order    | String   | The `sort_order` parameter lets you set the result sorting order. Use 'asc' for ascending and 'desc' for descending. By default, results are sorted in 'desc' order, arranging them from newest to oldest based on creation time.    |
| next\_cursor   | String   | Utilize the `next_cursor` parameter to access the next batch of results when paginating. This field will be present under `response_metadata` in the previous API response.                                                          |
| limit          | Number   | Specify the number of results per response (1-100), defaulting to 50.                                                                                                                                                                |
| filter\_by     | String   | Specify which field to use for sorting and filtering. Allowed values: `created_at`, `updated_at`. Defaults to `created_at` if not specified. When set to `updated_at`, requests are sorted and paginated by their last updated time. |
| after          | ISO Date | Employ the `after` parameter to fetch entities created after the provided ISO8601 date. The default value is None.                                                                                                                   |
| before         | ISO Date | Use the `before` parameter to retrieve entities created before the provided ISO8601 date. The default value is None.                                                                                                                 |
| include        | String   | Must be set to the exact value `messages` to include the list of associated messages (`messages` array) within the response object.                                                                                                  |
| state          | String   | Fetches Request's based on their State (`open`, `on_hold`, `in_progress`, `solved`, `pending`, `closed`)                                                                                                                             |
| channel\_id    | String   | Fetch all requests created in a specific **Request Channel**, using the channel\_id (ex :- `CABC1234`)                                                                                                                               |
| author\_emails | String   | Fetch all Requests created by an User via their **email** (ex :- `xyz@gmail.com`)                                                                                                                                                    |

**IMPORTANT POINTS :**\
\
1\) When using `filter_by=updated_at`, due to the dynamic nature of updated records, paginating through API responses may occasionally lead to repeated or missing entries if changes occur between requests. For consistent pagination results, consider using `filter_by=created_at` (default behavior).

2\) If you want to search for requests in **multiple states**, you need to add the **`state`** parameter **once for each state** in the URL.\
\
ex :- To get all requests that are in **OPEN** and **PENDING** state\
Request URL : `https://api.clearfeed.app/v1/rest/requests?state=open&state=pending`
